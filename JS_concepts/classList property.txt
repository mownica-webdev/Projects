classList property
The classList property is an interface provided by DOM (Document Object Model) elements in JavaScript. 
It provides a convenient way to access and manipulate the CSS classes applied to an element.
The classList property returns a DOMTokenList object, which represents a set of space-separated tokens
(i.e., CSS class names) for the element.

The classList interface exposes several methods that allow you to add, remove, toggle, and check for the 
presence of CSS classes on the element. 

Here's a brief explanation of each method:

1. add("className"): Adds the specified CSS class to the element's class list.
javascript code:
element.classList.add("className");

2. remove("className"): Removes the specified CSS class from the element's class list.
javascript code:
element.classList.remove("className");

3. toggle("className"): Toggles the presence of the specified CSS class. If the class is present, it removes it; if it's absent, it adds it.

javascript code:
element.classList.toggle("className");
contains("className"): Checks whether the specified CSS class is present in the element's class list. Returns true if present, false otherwise.

javascript code:
if (element.classList.contains("className")) {
    // Class is present
}

-The classList property simplifies the process of working with CSS classes compared to manually manipulating
 the className property, as it provides a more expressive and readable syntax for adding, removing, toggling,
 and checking classes.
-Additionally, it automatically handles whitespace and ensures that class manipulation is performed in a safe
 and efficient manner.



nav.classList.add("header-scrolled");
nav: 
-This variable likely represents a reference to an HTML element, specifically a navigation bar in this context.
-It's being selected using the querySelector method, which finds the first element in the document that matches
 the specified selector.

classList: 
-This is a property of the selected element (nav) that provides access to the list of CSS classes applied
 to that element.
-It returns a DOMTokenList object representing the set of classes.

add("header-scrolled"): 
-This is a method of the classList interface.
-It's used to add a new CSS class to the element's list of classes. 
-In this case, the class being added is "header-scrolled".
-After this line of code executes, the CSS class "header-scrolled" will be added to the list of classes 
 associated with the nav element.

In summary, the line of code nav.classList.add("header-scrolled"); dynamically modifies the classes applied to the navigation bar (nav) by adding the class "header-scrolled". This likely triggers changes in the navigation bar's appearance or behavior based on the CSS rules associated with the "header-scrolled" class. This kind of dynamic class manipulation is commonly used in web development to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.


The classList property is an interface provided by DOM (Document Object Model) elements in JavaScript. 
It gives access to the list of classes applied to a particular element.
 
Here's a brief explanation:
classList: It's an object that represents the classes of an element.
add("className"): This method adds a new class to the list of classes for the element.
remove("className"): This method removes a class from the list of classes for the element.
toggle("className"): This method toggles the presence of a class. 
                     If the class exists, it removes it; otherwise, it adds it.
contains("className"): This method checks if a class is present on the element.

-In the provided JavaScript code snippet, nav.classList.add("header-scrolled"); is using the add() method to 
 add the class "header-scrolled" to the list of classes associated with the nav element.
-This dynamically modifies the element's classes, allowing for changes in styling or behavior based on the 
 addition or removal of classes.
